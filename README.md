# General_Education

The purpose of this project is to create a completely open and sustainable workflow for aggregating assessment data forms, summarizing these data, and generating a forest plot. This plot will be used for reporting assessment data pertaining to student learning in the General Education program at Ferris State University. All data, R scripts, and reports will be housed in this repo and shared via a site in the Open Science Framework [http://osf.io/t6u8m].  
### File Descriptions ###

* README.md = this file
* BIOL200Data.csv = de-identified data for twelve semesters of student data from a 200-level Biology course.
* summarize.R = an R script that uses the BIOL200Data.csv file to generate a forest plot along with a weighted mean summary of the data.
* forest.pdf = the forest plot output produced by the summarize.R script.
