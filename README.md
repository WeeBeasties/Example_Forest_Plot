# General_Education

The purpose of this project is to create a completely open and sustainable workflow for aggregating assessment data forms, summarizing these data, and generating a forest plot. This plot will be used for reporting assessment data pertaining to student learning in the General Education program at Ferris State University. All data, R scripts, and reports will be housed in this repo and shared via a site in the Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/bax9i/].
